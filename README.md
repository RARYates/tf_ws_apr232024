# Introduction 
* This repo contains the community IP for 'Getting Started with Terraform on Azure'. 
* It is targetted at audience who are new to Terraform and Infrastrcuture-as-Code (though, prior ARM experience would be beneficial as well)
* We'll be focusing more on core constructs of Terraform that are required to write well-structured and maintainable code.
* PPTs directory contains the decks and Labs directory contains instructions. Participants are expected to bring their own Azure Dev Environment. (or MSDN subscription)
    * Unless subscription passes can be arranged 

# Getting Started
* 00_Workshop_Introduction.pptx (in PPTs) contain information on environment setup
* See Labs directory for step-by-step lab instructions. (will need to be kept updated as new AzureRM plugin versions are released)

# Build and Test
* **[Recommended]** Try out all the labs and keep a separate version of completed solution ready prior to delivery. 
* The above will be needed to show hands-on demos which usually makes up for at least 50% of the delivery.
* A pre-completed set of demos are located in Demos directory but **please make sure to test them out thoroughly yourself** prior to delivery.
